## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✔️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:
> 1. Install a Local Web Server: You can use solutions like XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP, or LAMP, depending on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). These packages include a preconfigured Apache web server, MySQL (or a similar database), and PHP, making it easier to set up your development environment.
> 2. Configure the Web Server:
    - Once you've installed the web server, you'll need to configure the folder where your PHP repository is located. This folder is typically named "htdocs" or "www" and is located within the installation directory of your web server.
    - Copy your PHP repository into the web server's folder.
> 3. Start the Web Server: Start the local web server from the control panel of the software you've installed (e.g., XAMPP or MAMP).
    Ensure that the web server is running and that there are no errors during startup.
> 4. Test the Application: Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost or http://127.0.0.1. This should load your PHP application if it's configured correctly in the web server's directory.
